# SECURE-BIOMEDICAL-DATA-COLLECTION-USING-MOBILE-SENSORS-BASED-ON-BLOCKCHAIN-TECHNOLOGY
This project enables secure biomedical data access through face recognition and blockchain. Patients book appointments remotely, consult doctors in person, and receive encrypted reports online. SHA-256 and decentralized storage ensure data privacy, tamper protection, and compliance with health regulations.
